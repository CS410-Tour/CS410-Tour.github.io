<p>At Umass Boston we are committed to creating a learning environment that promotes Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in our Computer Science courses. As part of this commitment, we embrace the following principles: 
<br>
<br>
  <strong>Diversity:</strong> We value diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, socio-economic background, age, religion, physical abilities, and educational experiences. We believe that a classroom that welcomes diverse perspectives and viewpoints enriches the learning experience for all students and prepares them to thrive in a global and interconnected world. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Equity:</strong> We aim to create an equitable learning environment in which every student has the opportunity to succeed. We recognize that individuals may come from different backgrounds and may require different types of support to excel in their studies. Our instructors are dedicated to providing equal opportunities while addressing the individual needs of each student by providing necessary accommodations and resources.  
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Inclusion:</strong> We promote a respectful, inclusive, and discrimination-free environment. We actively discourage any form of discrimination, harassment, or bias, and we encourage students to report any concerns they may have (see feedback survey below). 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Representation:</strong> We acknowledge the importance of diverse representation in the field of Computer Science and the tech industry as a whole. We aim to highlight and celebrate contributions from underrepresented groups in the curriculum and encourage diverse role models within the field to inspire and motivate all students. Our <a href="https://plans.bpcnet.org/UniversityOfMassachusetts-Boston_ComputerScience_DepartmentalBPCPlan.pdf" target="blank"> Broadening Participation in Computing plan</a> illustrates our dedication to representation of historically underrepresented groups in computing. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Accessibility:</strong> We recognize the importance of making our courses and materials accessible to all learners. We are committed to incorporating inclusive design principles and ensuring that digital resources are accessible to students with disabilities. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> We believe in the ongoing evaluation and improvement of our teaching practices, curriculum, and policies to better support DEI initiatives. We welcome feedback from students and the wider community to help us create an inclusive learning environment. We encourage students to inform their instructors should any DEI concerns arise during the semester; they may also contact the university office:

  By incorporating these principles into our Computer Science courses, we aim to empower our students to become not only skilled and innovative technologists but also advocates for diversity, equity, and inclusion in their future careers. In doing so, we believe we can collectively advance our department's mission of excellence in computer science and contribute to positive change in our field and society as a whole.
