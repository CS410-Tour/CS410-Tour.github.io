Facilities

The CS department employs a network of 46 Dell PowerEdge servers behind a Palo
Alto firewall to support our Computer Science and Information Technology
courses.  We also utilize two Dell Equal Logic and one Dell SCv3000 iSCSI SANs. Students use PCs in the UNIX Lab, Web Lab, and Information Technology (IT) Lab
to access the servers for their programming assignments.

The following information details the equipment in the various labs:

Lectern is connected to a LCD Laser Projector displaying 94" image onto the
projection screen.

IT students use them to access Linux and Windows Virtual Machines running on
the Dell PowerEdge servers.

All CS labs offer 24x7 access.  Users need to get a door code to access
the Web Lab (M-3-732) and the IT Lab (M-3-730) as they are instructional labs.
Access to the UNIX/PC Lab (M-3-731) requires a call to Public Safety if the
doors are closed.  Users need to make sure that their names are on the access
list posted on the wall next to the door of the UNIX/PC Lab.  All the labs are
maintained by three full-time system staff and a number of student operators.
The system satff along with the student operators provide help desk support
functions to faculty, staff, and students using a ticket request system
(RT).  A faculty member serves as the lab director to supervise the full-time
system staff and sets department IT policies and procedures.
