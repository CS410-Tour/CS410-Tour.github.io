title: "NIH R21 for TMS Visualization"
---

Brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), provide a new paradigm for treating brain disorders that cannot be effectively treated by traditional pharmacotherapies.

The goal of this research project is to develop a software that uses deep neural networks for real-time prediction and visualization of the electric field evoked by TMS. The deep neural network will be used to search for the optimal coil position that maximizes the stimulation of a selected brain target. Dr. Haehn and his student Loraine Franke will contribute to the data prediction and data visualization aspects of this grant.
