I have some exciting news: USENIX has received a generous grant
from the National Science Foundation in support of our conference
grant programs for the [31st USENIX Security Symposium](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22) and
the [Eighteenth Symposium](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2022) on Usable Privacy and Security!
We are eager to pass along this funding to your students in the form
of the following grant opportunities supporting attendance at the
symposia:
- Grants for Black Students: for students who are Black,
African American, or members of the larger African Diaspora
- Diversity Grants: for those who identify as female or who are
members of other groups underrepresented in tech
- Student Grants: open to all students
[USENIX Security '22](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/technical-sessions) and [SOUPS 2022](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2022/technical-sessions) will take place in early August,
with the option to participate in person in Boston, MA, or virtually.
Grants are available for both types of participation.
Please share this opportunity with your students and
colleagues who may qualify for these grants! Applications are
due on Monday, July 11, and can be found at the following links:

- [USENIX Security '22 grants](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/grants)
- [SOUPS 2022 grants](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2022/grants)
- [Student Members Save on Event Registrations](https://www.usenix.org/membership)

For students who are unable to secure a USENIX conference
grant, an annual [USENIX student membership](https://www.usenix.org/membership) provides
significant discounts to our events. Your students can join
USENIX at the reduced rate of $75 and receive special
registration rates for all conferences for the duration of their
membership. Membership also supports USENIX's [mission](https://www.usenix.org/about) and
commitment to open access.

The Early Bird registration and hotel reservation discount deadlines
for the symposia is Monday, July 18. Registration information is
available on the respective USENIX Security '22 and SOUPS
2022 websites.
