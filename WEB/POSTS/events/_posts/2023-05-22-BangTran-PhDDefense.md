<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b></p>

The rapid proliferation of Voice Assistant (VA) devices such as Amazon's Alexa, Google 
Home, and Apple's Siri has transformed how we interact with technology in our daily lives.
These devices provide users with hands-free access to various services, from weather forecasts
and news updates to music streaming and home automation. However, the convenience and
utility of VA devices come with a trade-off regarding privacy and security. Researchers have
noted that voice assistant devices may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors, who could
take control of the device or use it to access other devices on a user's network. Besides that,
leaking the biophysical status of the users from voice signals and being profiled by Voice
Service Providers (VSP) are recent concerns as the advances of Deep Learning techniques as
well as Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This dissertation first presents a solution to enhance the security of VA devices. Our proposed
defending system on the VA devices can against both voice replay and injection attacks
without any additional devices or any extra user’s effort. Specifically, we use both voice and
wireless data to verify the correlation between the user's presence and voice commands, then
finally detect the attacks.

Secondly, this dissertation proposes an anonymity scheme on VA devices to protecting users’
voice data from being linked to their accounts by the VSP. Our proposed scheme aims to mix
the queries from multiple VA users' devices, hiding the source of queries and hiding the relay's
real queries. To achieve effective anonymity, the anonymizer is equipped with a proposed
privacy-preserving pattern matching scheme, which is run with the help of a semi-trusted
server and is used to find the most effective relay for the requester based on their pattern
similarity.

Lastly, we introduce a framework VPASS, that supports managing personalized privacy
requirements for VA systems. Specifically, we propose mechanisms to quantify two key
aspects: the amount of information disclosure and the level of privacy sensitivity each voice
command has. Our mechanisms employ deep learning techniques for natural language
processing and can accurately detect privacy-sensitive commands based on an individual's
prior history of VAS interaction. Finally, VPASS generates monthly reports or immediate
privacy alerts based on the privacy policies pre-defined by users.
