After completing this course, you will be able to develop rich and interactive web-based 3D visualizations for computers, smartphones, and tablets! By using WebGL, you will learn to create immersive and high-quality graphics, including 3D geometric transformations, camera transformations, the image-rendering process, as well as materials and texture mapping. This course also includes advanced topics such as color representations, light simulation, dealing with geometries, and creating animations. And since everything runs in the browser, you can show your work to your friends with a link to a website-how cool is that!
